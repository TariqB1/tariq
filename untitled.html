      			<p>Sativas are known for motivating and getting you moving around versus vegging out on the couch. The leaves of a sativa are thin and spread apart. They have a higher levels of THC and lower levels of CBD (the chemical that's believed to aid pain relief and anxiety). Creativity flourishes when smoking a sativa and treating depression is a major reason for its use among medical patients.  Sativa strains are likely to get you talking, thinking, and philosophizing. </p>

      			<p>Indicas have a higher CBD content and are noted for their calming effects. The leaves are also wider and much closer together than a sativa plant. Indicas are helpful with pain relief, insomnia, and eliminating anxiety. It has been known to produce a heavy and relaxing body high. This can be great for muscle tension in athletes or as a way to unwind after a long workday.</p>

      			<p>Hybrids are the cherry on top of the cannabis sundae. They can be the perfect combination of energizing and relaxing, depending on the ratio of sativa to indica. Hybrids are created with the intention of maintaining the best qualities from both the sativa and indica parent plant, which often results in super-potent (and super popular) strains.</p>

      			<p>THC for short, this is the naturally occurring chemical in marijuana which gives you the feeling of being high. THC talks to your brain and signals it to release dopamine (the hormone and neurotransmitter that works with the pleasure and reward hubs.)</p>

      			<p>Those sugary looking crystals all over your weed—those are trichomes. That’s where the THC is hanging out, in the trichomes, all over the stems and leaves.  Up close they look like tiny mushrooms and can be a few different colors. The best scenario is for them to be milky or amber in color when you consume them. Milky trichomes will give you more of a cerebral high and amber colored ones will be more relaxing. If they are clear they aren’t going to be anywhere near as potent. ​</p>
